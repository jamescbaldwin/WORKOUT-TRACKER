# WORKOUT-TRACKER
MongoDB/Mongoose Application for Tracking Fitness

### USER STORY
```
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
```

### DEVELOPMENT & TECHNOLOGIES
Workout-Tracker renders a UI via HTML/CSS, with JavaScript for its front-end functionality. Locally, data is stored and accessed via MongoDB/Mongoose, as well as via API routing. Heroku accesses data per MongoDB's cloud software Atlas.
